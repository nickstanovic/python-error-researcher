## Windows Error Researcher
This is a Python script that retrieves and analyzes Windows Event Viewer logs to identify common errors and provide solutions. The script is designed to help users troubleshoot and fix issues with their Windows systems.

# Background
This script was originally written in PowerShell to help me research and diagnose Windows errors. I wanted to rewrite the script in Python as a way to learn the language and expand my programming skills.

# Requirements
Python 3.x Windows operating system (tested on Windows 11)

# Usage
To run the script, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the script. Then, run the following command: python main.py
